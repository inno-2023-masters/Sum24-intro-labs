## Task 1

Signing commits is a way to improve security of the repository as it ensures that changes are made by the trusted individual.

## Task 2

### Standard Merge

Pros:

- Keeps complete history of commits
- Default approach, thus it is easier for all collaborators to understand and use it

Cons:

- History of changes is harder to follow and can become a mess

Why default?

It enhances the ability of collaborators to trace changes made in the repository as well as the ability to keep track of context of these changes.

### Squash and Merge

Pros:

- Produces cleaner history by reducing number of commits

Cons: 

- Loses metadata about individual contributions thus making detailed history harder to trace back.

### Rebase and Merge

Pros:

- Clear and linear history which is really easy to navigate

Cons:

- Possibility to rewrite changes made earli
