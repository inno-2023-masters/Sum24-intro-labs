# Cloud Computing Lab - Artifact Registries and Serverless Computing Platforms

## Task 1: Artifact Registries Research

- **AWS CodeArtifact**:

  - Consume packages from public artifact repositories
  - Publish and share packages
  - Approve packages for use and get visibility into package usage
  - High availability and durability
  - Use a fully managed service
  - Enable access control and monitoring
  - Access packages within a VPC

- **GCP Artifact Registry**:
  - Secure and consistent
  - Automate building and deployment
  - Native artifact format support
  - High performance and availability
  - Vulnerability scanning insights
  - Prevent deployment of risky images
  - Regional and multi-regional repositories
  - Multiple repositories per Google Cloud project
  - Repository-native IAM with granular permissions
- **Azure Container Registry**:
  - Registry service tiers
  - Security and access
  - Versioned Storage
  - Supported images and artifacts
  - Automated image builds

## Task 2: Serverless Computing Platform Research

- **AWS Lambda**:

  - Extend other AWS services with custom logic
  - Build custom backend services
  - Bring your own code
  - Completely automated administration
  - Built-in fault tolerance
  - Package and deploy functions as container images
  - Automatic scaling
  - Connect to relational databases
  - Fine-grained control over performance
  - Connect to shared file systems
  - Run code in response to Amazon CloudFront requests
  - Orchestrate multiple functions
  - Integrated security model
  - Trust and integrity controls
  - Only pay for what you use
  - Flexible resource model
  - Integrate Lambda with your favorite operational tools
  - Achieve up to 34% better price performance with functions powered by Graviton2
  - Monitoring and observability

- **GCP Cloud Functions**:

  - Connects and extends services to build complex applications
  - End-to-end development and diagnosability
  - Develop locally, scale globally
  - No server management
  - Runs code in response to events
  - Pay only for what you use
  - Avoid lock-in with open technology
  - Simplified developer experience and increased developer velocity

- **Azure Functions**:
  - Serverless applications
  - Choice of language
  - Pay-per-use pricing model
  - Bring your own dependencies
  - Integrated security
  - Simplified integration
  - Flexible development
  - Stateful serverless architecture
  - Open-source
