# Benefits of Signing Commits

## For Individual Developers
Signing commits provides significant benefits for individual developers by ensuring authenticity and integrity. Using SSH or GPG keys, developers can prove their identity and protect their code from unauthorized changes, thereby building trust and a solid reputation within the development community.

## For Organizations
For organizations, S/MIME signed commits enhance security and compliance. They ensure that all code contributions come from verified sources. This helps to meet all rules and regulations and keeps a record of everything we do. This way, we can be sure that everything is done correctly and that there's no chance of anything going wrong. It also helps to create a culture where everyone takes responsibility for their actions and is transparent about what they're doing.

## For Bots
Signature verification for bots is essential for maintaining the integrity of automated processes. When bots sign their changes, it makes sure that the automated changes are legitimate and safe, preventing anyone from tampering with them or performing unauthorized actions. This trust in automation helps ensure our continuous integration and deployment processes are reliable and secure.
