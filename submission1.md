# Benefits of Signing Commits

## For Individual Developers
Signing commits provides significant benefits for individual developers by ensuring authenticity and integrity. Using SSH or GPG keys, developers can prove their identity and protect their code from unauthorized changes, thereby building trust and a solid reputation within the development community.

## For Organizations
For organizations, S/MIME signed commits enhance security and compliance. They ensure that all code contributions come from verified sources. This helps to meet all rules and regulations and keeps a record of everything we do. This way, we can be sure that everything is done correctly and that there's no chance of anything going wrong. It also helps to create a culture where everyone takes responsibility for their actions and is transparent about what they're doing.

## For Bots
Signature verification for bots is essential for maintaining the integrity of automated processes. When bots sign their changes, it makes sure that the automated changes are legitimate and safe, preventing anyone from tampering with them or performing unauthorized actions. This trust in automation helps ensure our continuous integration and deployment processes are reliable and secure.

### Standard Merge
**Pros**: Saves the complete commit history, including the context of branch merges. This helps you keep track of changes and understand why and when they were made. Simplifies conflict resolution, as changes from different branches are clearly separated.
**Cons**: The commit history can become cluttered due to the multitude of merge commits. This can make it difficult to read the history of changes and make it more difficult to understand the sequence of updates.

Standard Merge is often preferred because it simplifies conflict resolution. When multiple developers work on different features, conflicts are inescapable. Merge commits clearly separate changes from different branches, making it easier to identify and resolve conflicts without losing track of individual contributions.

### Squash and Merge
**Pros**: Creates a clean commit history by combining all changes from a branch into a single commit. This makes it easier to manage the history and roll back changes, since all changes are in one commit.
**Cons**: Loss of detailed history of individual commits from the branch. This can make debugging difficult, as the context and sequence of changes are lost.
### Rebase and Merge
**Pros**: Creates a linear and clean commit history without merge commits. This makes it easier to understand the history of the project and makes it more orderly.
**Cons**: Rewriting history can be risky and confusing. Requires careful management to avoid conflicts and loss of commits. It can make it difficult to work together, especially in large teams.
